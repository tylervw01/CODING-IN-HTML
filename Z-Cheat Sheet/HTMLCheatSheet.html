    <p>Hello, world! This is a basic P tag for paragraphs.</p>

    <p>Hello, world! This is a STRONG tag for <strong> a bolder look in my paragraphs.</strong></p>

    <p>Hello, world! this is a EM tag for <em>EMPHASIS</em>.</p>

    <p>Hello, world! this is a U tag for <u>UNDERLINING</u> words/phrases.</p>

    <p>Hello, world! this is a SUP tag used for SUPERSCRIPTing like so:
        1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>__<sup><= see :D.
        </sup></p>
    
    <p>Hello, world! this is a SUB tag for SUBSCRIPTing, for e.g:
       The chemical formula for water is H<sub>5</sub>0  <sub><= like so :D.
    </sub>
    </p>

     <p>Hello, world! this is a DEL tag, used to strike through text, for e.g => Special Price: <del>$100</del> $75.</p>
    </p>

    <p>Hello, world! this MARK tag, is used to <mark>HIGHLIGHT TEXTS. <sup>:D</sup></mark>

    </p>

     <p>Hello, world! BLOCKQUOTE tags are used for longer, block quotes: <p>As Albert Einstein once said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world. The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote speaks to the idea that creativity and original thinking are more important than simply accumulating knowledge. It suggests that being able to see beyond what is already known and to imagine new possibilities is a key characteristic of intelligence.</p>
    </p>

    <p>Hello, world! this is a CITE tag. It is used to mark up title or source of a book, song, or any other creative work, also to indicate a reference to another source. E.G: I recently read <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite> by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  </p>

    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to my first HTML page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre></p>

<p>THE KBD & SAMP TAGS</p>
<p>In addition to the CODE and PRE tags, there are several other HTML tags that can be used to format and display computer code and preformatted text, such as KBD for displaying keyboard input and SAMP for displaying sample output.
</p>

<h4>WHAT ARE HTML LISTS</h4>
<p>They allow you to group a set of related items or pieces of information together. There are three types of lists in html: unordered lists; ordered lists and definition lists. First of all we have the:</p>
<h5>UNORDERED LISTS</h5>
<ul>
    <li>ITEM 1</li>
    <li>ITEM 2</li>
    <li>ITEM 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we have the:</p>
<h5>ORDERED LISTS</h5>
<ol>
    <li>FIRST ITEM</li>
    <li>SECOND ITEM</li>
    <li>THIRD ITEM</li>

    <p>Also we have:</p>
    <h5>DEFINITION LISTS</h5>
    <p>Definition lists are created with DL tag, and are used to display a list of terms and their definitions. Each term is represented by the DT tag, and each definition is represented by the DD tag</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>TERM 1</dt>
        <dd>Definition 1</dd>
        <dt>TERM 2</dt>
        <dd>Definition 2</dd>
        <dt>TERM 3</dt>
        <dd>Definition 3</dd>
    </dl>
</ol>

<h5>NESTED LISTS</h5>
<p>HTML allows you to nest lists within other lists. This means you can create a hierarchy of information, where sub-lists are indented to show they belong to a parent list item.</p>
<ul>
    <li>FIRST ITEM</li>
    <li>SECOND ITEM
        <ul>
            <li>Sub-Item 1</li>
            <li>THIRD SUB ITEM
                <ol>
                    <li>third sub item but numbered</li>
                    <li>Also a third sub :D</li> 
                    </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Sub-Item 2</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>THIRD ITEM</li>
    <li>FOURTH :)</li>
</ul>

<h3>WHAT ARE HTML TABLES?</h3>
<p>HTML Tables are used to display data in rows and columns. They are a great way to present data in a structured and organized way.</p>
<p>Tables are made up of rows and columns, and each intersection of a row and a column is called a cell. Each cell in a table can contain text, images or other HTML elements</p>
<h3>LETS CREATE A BASIC TABLE</h3>
<p>To create a basic table, you need to use three elements: TABLE, TR and TD.
    The TABLE element defines the entire table, and the TR element defines a row within the table. The TD element defines a cell within a row.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A BASIC TABLE WITH TWO ROWS AND TWO COLUMNS:</h4>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>ROW 1, COLUMN 1</td>
        <td>ROW 1, COLUMN 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ROW 2, COLUMN 1</td>
        <td>ROW 2, COLUMN 2</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h4>HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A TABLE WITH A HEADER ROW:</h4>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>SERVICE</th>
            <th>PRICES</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>WEB DESIGN</td>
            <td>R 10,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>GRAPHICS DESIGN</td>
            <td>R 6,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>CONTENT WRITING</td>
            <td>R 4,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT</td>
            <td>R 3,350</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
<hr><hr>   

<h3>MERGING CELLS</h3>
<p>Creates larger cells that span multiple rows or columns. Useful for creating HEADINGS, SUB-HEADINGS, or data cells that have to span across several columns or rows. You can merge cells in a table using the colspan and rowspan attributes. The colspan attribute specifies how many columns a cell should span (merges cells horizontally), while the rowspan attribute specifies how many rows a cell should span (merges cells vertically).

</p>
<h4>HERES AN EXAMPLE OF A TABLE WITH MERGING CELLS</h4>
<h5><mark>AND CAPTION ELEMENT USAGE</mark></h5>
<table>
            <p>Here is a quick sample of the <mark>CAPTION ELEMENT being used to indicate a title</mark> or a caption to a HTML table</p>
        <caption>=> <mark>FACTORY FLOOR</mark> <=</caption> 
    <tr>
        <th rowspan="2">PRODUCTS:</th>
        <th colspan="2">PRICES:</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>OLD</th>
        <th>NEW</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>PRODUCT 1</td>
        <td>$10.00</td>
        <td>$12.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>PRODUCT 2</td>
        <td>$15.00</td>
        <td>$18.00</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<hr>
<h4>THE TABLE TAG AND ITS ATTRIBUTES</h4>
<p>Here's an example of a table that uses all of the listed attributes:
</p>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="5" width="80%" height="200" align="center" bgcolor="#f2f2f2">
  <tr>
    <th>Product</th>
    <th>Price</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Product 1</td>
    <td>$10.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Product 2</td>
    <td>$15.00</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<hr>
<h4>Other Table-Specific Attributes
</h4>
<p>Along with commonly used, though deprecated, attributes such as border, cellpadding, and cellspacing, there is another attribute that plays an essential role in improving the user experience. This is the summary attribute, which gives a summary of the table for users who use assistive technologies like screen readers.

Here is an example:</p>

<table>
  <caption>Monthly Sales</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Month</th>
      <th>Sales</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>January</td>
      <td>$10,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>February</td>
      <td>$12,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>March</td>
      <td>$15,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>Total</td>
      <td>$37,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
  <summary>This table shows the monthly sales figures for the first quarter of the year.</summary>
</table>
