# Harbor Light Community Center Website: Adding Accessibility and Structured Data
<!--
Scenario
The local community center, "Harbor Light Community Center," currently has a basic website that provides information about its services, events, and educational programs. While the website is functional, it lacks semantic structure, accessibility features, and modern web practices that could enhance user experience and accessibility. You, as an aspiring web developer, have volunteered to revamp the website.

Your goal is to apply your understanding of semantic markup, accessibility, and HTML best practices to make the website more informative, accessible, and user-friendly for everyone in the community.-->
